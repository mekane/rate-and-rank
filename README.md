# Rate and Rank

I wanted a way to quickly put together lists of things (e.g. red wine vintages, olive oil brands, indian dishes) and give them
numeric ratings as well as sort (rank) them. I want this to be flexible and easy to configure and not be as slow and clunky as
a Google sheet or doc.

## Setup and Run

   * `npm install`
   * `npm run build` (or `npm run watch`)
   * cd to server/ and `npm start`
