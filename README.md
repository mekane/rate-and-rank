# Rate and Rank

I wanted a way to quickly put together lists of things (e.g. red wine vintages, olive oil brands, indian dishes) and give them
numeric ratings as well as sort (rank) them. I want this to be flexible and easy to configure and not be as slow and clunky as
a Google sheet or doc.

## Setup and Run

   * `npm install`
   * `npm run build`
   * open the file `public/index.html` in a browser.
   * Enjoy!
