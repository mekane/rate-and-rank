    <h1>Welcome to the Rate and Rank App</h1>
    <p>
        Rate and Rank is a flexible grid of data that can be configured to suit a variety
        of needs. It was created to set up custom lists of things that could be tracked,
        annotated, rated, and ranked. Examples would be bottles of red wine or olive oil,
        brands of shampoo you've tried, favorite movies or favorite indian food dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site hosts some demos to show different ways you can configure a grid as well
        as some of the features they offer. These demos run completely in the browser and
        don't save changes, so they will revert if you refresh the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site also includes an area where you can login and create grids that will persist
        server-side. Once authenticated you can use a REST API to create and query your grids
        as well as send actions to them. (The grid view for persistent grids uses the API).
